# Changelog

## 0.1.2 - 2026-03-23

Minor release focused on the continuity layer MVP and runtime-backed review guidance.

- Added the first continuity layer MVP so `check`, MCP, and the agent-native loop now surface reuse targets, new surface files, continuity breaks, future maintenance risks, and continuity-specific next actions
- Added an OSS continuity detector for broadened implementation surface, likely parallel abstractions, and continuity-sensitive structure changes
- Updated the runtime-backed review surface and public docs so the new continuity guidance is visible in both CLI and agent-native flows

## 0.1.1 - 2026-03-23

Patch release focused on onboarding and cross-platform usability.

- Shortened the install guidance so the default path is `npm install -g agent-guardrails`
- Added `npx agent-guardrails ...` as the fallback when the global binary is not on `PATH`
- Made the onboarding docs and troubleshooting guidance shell-neutral across Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Added release regressions so the public docs stay platform-neutral

## 0.1.0 - 2026-03-22

Initial public release.

- Added a zero-dependency CLI with `init`, `plan`, and `check`
- Added presets for `node-service`, `nextjs`, `python-fastapi`, and `monorepo`
- Added task contracts with path, required-command, and evidence-file enforcement
- Added first-pass adapters for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenHands, and OpenClaw
- Added bounded-scope demo and install smoke validation
- Added GitHub Actions templates for both maintainers and initialized user repos
